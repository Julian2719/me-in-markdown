## Introduction
        Hello, my name is Julian, I am in 10th grade and I have a younger brother who is 9 years old. I don't have a favorite book and my favorite movie is conjuring 2 because I enjoy watching horror movies with a good story line. I enjoy the thrill of wating horror movies. One new skill I recently learned was cooking so I learned how to cook for others and my self. I really enjoy playing volleyball, going to the gym, and cooking. 
        As a sophomore I am trying to maintain and get straight A's this school year. This summer I went to palm springs with my family and we went swimming, cooked barbeque and even went shopping. One of my favorite meals to eat is chicken alfredo because I know how to cook it and it tastes amazing as well. I really enjoy playing volleyball, I feel like now its one of the main things I think about. I am also planning to continue high school volleyball and club volleyball to persue college volleyball in the future. 
        I have a really fun memory I had with some of my friends which was that we went to one of our friends birthday parties and we had a pool party. I think we all had an amazing time we ate tacos, went swimming, and ate cake. It was an amazing time. In the future I really hope to get into a great college. Some of my dream colleges are UCLA, UC Berekley and University of Hawaii. For my career I want to do is business particularly studing business at UC Berekley.
